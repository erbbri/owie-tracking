# OwieTracking

## Motivation 
People who experience chronic illness often have to track many aspects of their lives, such as medications, symptoms, food intake, and pain levels. Our goal with the development of OwieTracking is to ease the time to track these aspects while also reminding the user to complete and record their habits. Currently the options on the market are very limiting.  Many current symptom-tracking apps are specific to one particular condition or have their highly-customizable features hidden behind monthly subscriptions. Those looking for a way to monitor their health are left choosing between using multiple applications or paying for the features they need.  <br><br>

OwieTracking is intended to be a free highly customizable and flexible tracking and reminder application with the ability to export the data collected as a PDF. OwieTracking will provide reminders to record these habits and symptoms at times and frequencies set by the user and will record the user’s history to allow them to view any important trends and potential correlations. Thus, the user will be able to streamline the process of tracking their data, and the users and their doctors can use the data collected to identify patterns that may lead to a better treatment plan.
